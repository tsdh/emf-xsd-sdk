# emf-xsd-sdk

This project's purpose is to simplify the process of making EMF technologies
available via Maven by packing the contents of the JARs in the EMF All-In-One
SDK bundle into one single JAR, and pushing that as an artifact to the public
[Clojars Maven repository](http://clojars.org)

## Usage

This project is based on the excellent
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) tool, which you need to
install first.  Furthermore, you need an account at
[Clojars](http://clojars.org).

Once these requirements are met, this is the procedure to create a new
emf-xsd-sdk release and push it to [Clojars](http://clojars.org/emf-xsd-sdk).

1. Download the current EMF All-In-One SDK (`emf-xsd-SDK-x.y.z.zip`) from the
[EMF Homepage](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/).

2. Adjust the version number in `project.clj` to match the EMF release.
(Please, only release stable versions.  Or simply create an issue here at
github and request that I do a new release.)

3. Unzip it somewhere, and copy all JAR files in `eclipse/plugins/` to this
project's `emf-jars` folder.

4. Run the `do-release.zsh` script.

That will create one single JAR containing all EMF classes (examples and docs
are not included) and upload it to clojars.
